I have been struggling through my Open Data Project and trying to complete it. I have gone through many different types of data and have submtted the declartation form too many times. I have mostly been putting the assignment on the back foot and focussing more on my other units. 

The main problwem I had with previous sets of data was the not having stadard unicode characters and not know ing how to fiix it. Trying to import different libraires so that when I ran a code it didn't come back with a Unicode error has been frustrating. 

I'm not expecting to do well on this assignment, I barely know if I will have anything to hand in.
