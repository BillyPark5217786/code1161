This week was a difficult task to complete. 
What I;m finding with attempting most exercises is that it is mostly trial and error. Given all the time in the world I'm sure I could compplete the exercises. But the idead of the exam coming up makes me worried that I will not be able to complete a significant portion of it.

Get_some_details proved to be very troublesome and took me a number of hours to complete. The main issue was trying to figure out how to add both ID and the postcode together. After a time I realised that they both had to be converted to str.

Understanding get_some_details helped me greatly in wunderground. The main problem I had was using https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/ the website proved to be very buggy. I managed but had an issue trying to load the .json into the reader not realising I was using www and https instead of http.

Diarist I completed in a relatively short ammount of time. I completed the task manually counting the number of times the command appeared. But I wanted to attempt to automate the process. There were a lot of syntax mistakes and errors to try and get the code to read gcode files.

Wordy_pyramid proved the hardest to complete. I'm still having trouble with it. Attempting to psuedocode the process by which the random word genorator will step up 2 letters each time a new line is doing my head in.
