I've learnt how to run functions and algorithms. Learning the syntax and the proper use of inputs and functions is still proving difficult.
I tried to complete the exercises as much as I could but being stuck on one problem hinders being able to move to the next as some tasks require the solution I used previously to complete the next.
I'm still in the foruth week and I still don't know what's going on. As much as I try and google solutions to problems I just sit here and change brackets or input functions hoping I will get a different answer or that the function will run properly. But what mostly returns is an Syntax error, which I usually fix with a colon. I have completed some task to where it outputs a result that I want but it's not the correct result to pass the test.py so I'm stuck thinking I have a working solution that isn't correct. 
I've been looking through Hangman and exercise 2 to find examples or functions that might work. Sometimes they seem to work, and other they don't. I'm going to keep trying at it over the break. naking sure read up and watch a whole bunch of tutorials, but until then I don't know if I have these exercises complete or right.
