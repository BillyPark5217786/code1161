I have tried and tried to complete these exercises. But none of my solutions seem to work.

I think a big problem is trying to figure out the mathmatics to the triangles. 
Another problem I experienced was the .math had to be included on the import functions for some of the calculation to work.

The examples of the recursions helped but I didn't quite figure out how they worked properly. Overall this week has been a bit of a struggle to complete. I will work on the problems after the submission date despite not having them all completed. The main problem I am seeing is how to take these examples we learn in tutorial and transfer them into real applications or situations.
