This week I learned how to code ascending and decending lists using different functions and variables.

I am am still unsure what all this coding actually does. I follow the tutorials and listen to what the tutors have said, but how the functions actually work has not clicked in my head. I am going to do some private learning on lynda and other sources to trry and better understand what actuall goes on when I input a command.

I can see it and see what it does but I'm just having trouble understanding the purpose.
