This week I have learned how a machine learning exercise. While I didn't quite get the code to work, it was interesting to go through different itterations of psuedo code that could have worked fro the project.

Overall it was interesting to see code actually work in a real time function and to be applied to an actual visual output that isn't text on the screen. To see the power that python can have in real world applications.

Starting the open data project I had a bit of difficulty understanding how to intergrate the data in jupyter labbook. But going through the kaggle tutorial helped a bit. I'm still trying to choose a data set and apply a question to it. hopefully by next weeks tutorial I will have a had a foundation ready.
