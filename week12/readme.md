Final week to complete and present my open data project.

I'm still struggling with this project, particualrly in the area of choosing a data set to present.

Trying to learn matplotlib is a frustrating effort as well a pandas.
Trying to clean the data is an unending task of TypeErros and Key Errors and learning the interface for Kaggle.
